# Bot-Bucket-Static-Analysis-and-Classification-of-Botnets-and-Malwares
Network Security Research Project
Created an intrusion detection system which analyses according to host and network.
Classification of this system is designed to effectively deal with the malware and the obfuscated bot binaries. Used recurrent neural networks to train and classify the system with an accuracy of 73%.
